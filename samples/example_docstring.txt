Updates the docstring of a specified function within a Python source file.

This function reads a Python file, parses its source code to find the
function with the given name, and then replaces its existing docstring
with the provided new docstring. The updated source code is then written
back to the same file, effectively updating the file in-place.

Parameters:
filename (str): The path to the Python source file where the function
                whose docstring is to be updated is located.
function_name (str): The name of the function whose docstring needs
                        updating. The function should be defined at the
                        top level of the module (not nested inside other
                        classes or functions).
new_docstring (str): The new docstring content that will replace the
                        existing docstring of the specified function.

Raises:
FileNotFoundError: If the file specified by `filename` does not exist.
SyntaxError: If the source code in `filename` is not valid Python code.
ValueError: If no function with the name `function_name` exists in the
            file, or if the file contains no functions at all.

Returns:
None: The function does not return any value. It modifies the file directly.

Example:
>>> update_docstring("example.py", "my_function", "This is the new docstring.")
# This will update the docstring of `my_function` in `example.py` file.

Note:
This function does not handle functions defined within classes or other
scopes; only top-level functions are supported.
